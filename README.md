# LazyDummy

## What even is this?: 
This is a janky fusion of two ESO addons, Armory Build Display and Dolgubon's Lazy Writ Creator -- please support the original authors!



## Who the hell needs this?:
This is for people who maintain separate builds for crafting and combat, who sometimes forget to use their crafting loadout when doing writs, then get annoyed at their crappy Rank 1 rewards. 



## OK, but what it do?:
ArmoryBuildDisplay will display the name of the currently-equipped armory build. 
If the name contains "craft", it will be in green; otherwise it will be red.

Modifications to Dolgubon's cause the following behavior:
When picking up daily writ quests, the addon will check the name of currently-equipped armory build.
If the name does NOT contain "craft", the quests will not be picked up automatically -- instead, the addon will insult you for trying and remind you you're not on crafting build -- each quest can still be manually accepted. 



## How I use?:
Download the repo and put everything in your AddOns folder, and say "yes" when prompted to replace QuestHandler.lua
**NOTE: This repository includes Armory Build Display in its entirety; however, it only contains one file from Dolgubon's Lazy Writ Creator**


Once installed, make sure your crafting build contains "craft" in its description (it's a wildcard, don't need exact match), and switch back and forth between your two builds so that 
**NOTE: If the game crashes or you use Alt+F4 to rage-quit, your build may be displayed incorrectly**
